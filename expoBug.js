This error occurs when using Expo CLI with certain versions of Node.js or when there are conflicts in project dependencies. The error message itself might not be very informative, often showing a generic error like `Error: Command failed: ...` or a similar message related to the build process failing.  Debugging this requires carefully examining the complete error log and checking for dependency conflicts.
