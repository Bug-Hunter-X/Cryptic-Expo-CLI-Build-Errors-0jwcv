The solution involves a methodical approach:

1. **Examine the complete error log:** The error message may only be the tip of the iceberg. Look for deeper details within the error log to pinpoint the root cause.  Look for specific error messages regarding packages or modules.
2. **Check Node.js version:** Ensure your Node.js version is compatible with the Expo CLI version you are using.  Check the Expo documentation for compatibility information.
3. **Review package.json:** Examine your `package.json` file for any conflicting dependencies or outdated packages. Use `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to identify outdated packages and update them using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) and then rebuilding the project.
5. **Simplify dependencies:** If you have many dependencies, try temporarily removing some to see if that resolves the issue. This helps isolate problematic packages.
6. **Check Expo SDK version:** Ensure your Expo SDK version is compatible with other packages in your app.
7. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** If the above steps fail, try to create a minimal, reproducible example that demonstrates the error. This can greatly assist in diagnosing the issue.

Example Code in `expoBug.js` (This might not demonstrate the exact error but show a case where something like a package conflict might cause problems) 
```javascript
// expoBug.js (Illustrative - might not be the precise cause of the cryptic error)
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import SomeConflictingPackage from 'some-conflicting-package'; // Hypothetical conflicting package

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      <SomeConflictingPackage/> {/*This might cause a cryptic error if conflicting*/}
    </View>
  );
}
```
